This is the 1st project from The Odin Project's Full Stack "JavaScript" curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript. 

It is a library app that allows users to store book data. There are 2 versions: 
(1) The cloud version uses Google's Firebase database to store the data in the cloud. 
(2) The local storage version uses the users' device (browser local storage) to store the data. 

Focus Areas:
- Objects and object constructors in JavaScript
- Local Storage API
- Firebase API (Authentication, Database)
