# Library App

This is a virtual library app that allows users to store book information either on the user's device memory or in the cloud. 

[Live Demo](https://jonro2955.github.io/odin_javaScript_1_library/)

There are 2 versions: The first is a cloud storage version using Google's Firebase database to store the data in the cloud. 
The second is a local storage version using the user's device memory allocated to the users' internet browser that is being used to view the app.
